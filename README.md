# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to explore and visualize data from the FIFA 18 player dataset using Tableau. I wanted to uncover patterns in player ratings, market value, and nationality trends, and create an engaging dashboard that could answer a few core questions about how players are represented in the game. Ultimately, the aim was to practice end-to-end data storytelling—from data cleaning to visualization and presentation.

## Process
### (your step 1)
I connected Tableau to the fifa18_clean.csv file, which contains over 17,000 players and 70 attributes. I reviewed the structure, fixed some formatting issues (like converting “Value” from strings to numeric format), and started exploring different chart possibilities.
### (your step 2)
I built a series of visualizations to better understand the dataset. I started with player nationality, ratings distribution, and value. From there, I explored more specific trends—like attribute comparisons across positions (Agility, GK Reflexes), and what makes a player more valuable or “elite.”

## Results
I chose Option 2, using the FIFA18 player dataset. I focused my analysis on three key questions:

1. Are the highest-rated players always the most valuable?

2. Which nationalities produce the most top-rated players?

3. Where do most players fall in terms of overall rating?

To answer these, I created three dashboards:

1. A histogram showing the distribution of player ratings

2. A scatter plot comparing Overall Rating and Market Value

3. A bar chart of the top 10 countries with the most 80+ rated players

I also created supporting charts to analyze agility by position and GK-specific attributes, which helped fulfill the project prompts around trends and attribute-based insights.

## Challenges 
Some charts turned out visually messy or unclear, so I had to rethink how to structure my dashboards to keep them readable. I also spent time figuring out how to use different Tableau features and functionalities as I built the visualizations.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I’d explore clustering or predictive modeling, maybe using player attributes to estimate market value or categorize players into “types.” I’d also polish the dashboard design further, improve interactivity (filters, tooltips), and maybe add trend comparisons by age or potential ratings.
